# py-tictactoe

A simple multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game built with Python and Pygame, using sockets for two-player local network play.

## ðŸŽ® How It Works

- Two players each run their own instance of `tictactoe.py` to join the game as clients.
- Players take turns making moves by clicking on the board.
- The game automatically handles turn order and win/draw detection.
