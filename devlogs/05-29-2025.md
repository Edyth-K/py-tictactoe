### ✅ What I did today:
- wrapped server in try/except block to handle ctrl-c, port wasn't being freed upon exit
- bundled server and client together so you just run main along with optional arguments
    - python3 main.py [-c/-s]
    - -c for client, -s for server
- part of the game logic

### 🔧 What I’m working on next:
- threading for "asynchronous" message sending/ receiving

### ⚠️ Issues or blockers:
- message sending is synchronous, which ends up causing blocking (going to look into threading)

### 🧠 Notes / Thoughts:
